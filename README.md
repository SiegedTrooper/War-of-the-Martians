A story based game using RTS mechanics. Player is tasked with completing each mission to complete the story.

# Story

In the future, Mars has been colonized. Those who settled on Mars long ago have physically evolved to live on the planet. Their society has those who're pure blood (those who can live without life support) and those who need artificial environments to sustain their living, also known as colonists.

A separtist faction has splintered from the pure ones and vie for control of the planet. You're a local militia leader of colonists whos task is to protect the colonists, no matter what.
